1. How is the program writing the data to the file?
    the write system call

2. How many characters are we writing per call?
    1

3. What do each of the flags that we are passing to <code>open</code> do?
            O_WRONLY -- open file for writing only
            O_CREAT -- if the file does not exist, create it
            O_TRUNC -- if the file has data in it, truncate that data
            O_SYNC -- write all data synchronously through to the disk

What has changed?
    We removed the sync flag

What should happen?
    It should go faster
