stringlib.[ch]
    This prototypes a single library for using a length+bytes representation
    for strings. We provide function prototypes and skeleton implementations
    so students can implement this library.

    The learning objective is to become comfortable with pointer manipulation
    and allocation of meta-data surrounding user objects.

string_test.c
    This is a test harness to test implementations of the stringlib.

    It allows for:
    creating strings
    freeing strings
    duplication strings
    comparing strings
    concatenating strings
    printing strings
