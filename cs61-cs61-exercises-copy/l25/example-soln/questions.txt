1. If you forget to close the accepted fd in the parent, then you might run
out of open files after about a thousand requests (1056).  If you got that
right, then you might find that fork fails at some point, because you've
created too many processes (this happens after about 3754 connections for us).

2. Hmmm -- appeared to start running more quickly, but failed to allocate
memory after a few hundred threads.

3. The pool-based solution got to 200 quickly, but then slowed down to
a *really* slow rate.
